Designed an unsupervised consumer segmentation pipeline using K-Modes to cluster mixed categorical survey data for a coffee retailer. Identified four distinct customer segments (e.g., price-sensitive commuters, premium loyalists) and translated segment behavior into pricing and retention strategies to optimize customer lifetime value. Delivered segment profiles and recommendations via reproducible Python workflows and GitHub documentation.

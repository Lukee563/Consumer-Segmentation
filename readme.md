## Coffee Consumer Business Analysis - Consumer Segmentation
### Clustering Consumers with Survey Responses

Working with a Coffee Consumer Survey Data Set from The Great American Coffee Taste Test (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-05-14/readme.md) to establish if individuals can be grouped into customer classes based on high-level survey data. Using Gower/PMA cluster analysis, individuals are grouped into clusters through survey responses such as their daily coffee consumption information, their preferred location to drink/purchase coffee, and their preferred drinks and roasts.  


## Project I
Using data from a 2023 survey of “Great American Coffee Taste Test” viewers, I will be exploring consumer trends of American coffee enthusiasts, primarily through spending demographics and coffee preferences. Project I focuses on data collection and aggregation. 

## Project 2
Project II performs the necessary EDA to establish natural groupings and patterns in the data for an eventual clustering analysis for categorical data.

## Project 3
Using Gower/PAM clustering for categorical (one-hot encoded) data, I am looking to identify distinct “customer-classes” by analyzing individual, self reported data on their coffee drinking habits (location, preferred roast, preferred drinking location, reason for drinking coffee) and demographic characteristics such as their age, gender, educational background, and number of children. Identifying prominent characteristics that lead to vast differences in consumer spending can be beneficial to any corporation looking to target the right kind of consumers through advertising.

## Project 4
I will be generating new data based on the historic distribution of each column, with a normalized error, for each instance of a factor-level simulation. I will end up with 90 randomly generated, similar data to the current survey results, each with different amount of observations or sparistiy depending on the factor-level specification. I will be evaluating the performance of the Proximus algorithm from the Clustering for Business Analytics R package by Christian Buchta. I will be exploring how this algorithm handles data matrices with a differing number of observations, and how logical matrix sparsity effects the cluster output.
